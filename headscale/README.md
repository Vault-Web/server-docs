# Headscale ‚Äî Self-Hosted VPN Coordination Server

## 1. Why Do We Need a VPN?

Before we understand what **Headscale** does, it‚Äôs important to first see **how communication normally works without a VPN** ‚Äî and why that‚Äôs a potential security risk.

---

### 1.1 Communication Without a VPN

Imagine you have two devices:

* üíª **Laptop** ‚Äî connected to a public Wi-Fi in a caf√©
* üè† **Home Server** ‚Äî running at your home or in a data center

If you try to connect to your server directly over the internet, here‚Äôs what happens:

1. Your laptop sends data packets to the **public IP address** of your home server.
2. Those packets travel through **multiple routers, ISPs, and gateways** across the internet.
3. Every one of those intermediaries can, in theory, **see, log, or manipulate** your data.

Even if certain applications (like HTTPS or SSH) encrypt some data, your **connection metadata** (e.g., IP addresses, ports, and server endpoints) remains visible.
To make your server accessible, you must usually open ports and forward them through your router ‚Äî exposing your home network to the internet.

That means:

* Attackers can **scan your public IP** and find open ports.
* They can try **brute-force attacks** or exploit known vulnerabilities.
* You must **secure every single service manually**, which is error-prone and complex.

### 1.2 The Problems With Public Exposure

Hosting services on the public internet comes with several downsides:

| Problem                      | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîì **Attack Surface**        | Every open port increases the chance of being attacked.                      |
| üß± **Firewall Complexity**   | You must manually configure port forwarding and access rules.                |
| üåç **No Private Networking** | Devices on different networks can‚Äôt communicate securely or directly.        |
| üïµÔ∏è **Metadata Leakage**     | Even if content is encrypted, IPs and endpoints are still visible to others. |

In short, your devices remain **isolated** unless you expose them publicly ‚Äî which is both **insecure and inconvenient**.

## 2. VPNs: Creating Private, Encrypted Networks

A **VPN** allows devices to communicate securely as if they were on the same LAN, even across the internet.
It encrypts all traffic and hides the network from outsiders.

### 2.1 How WireGuard VPN Works (Laptop ‚Üî Home Server Example)

Let‚Äôs take our caf√© laptop and home server scenario, using **classic WireGuard VPN only**:

#### Step 1: WireGuard Processes

| Device      | WireGuard Process Role                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Laptop      | - Initiates connection to the home server<br>- Maintains the encrypted tunnel<br>- Sends and receives encrypted packets<br>- Uses its private key to authenticate                                      |
| Home Server | - Listens for incoming WireGuard connections<br>- Maintains server-side end of the tunnel<br>- Uses its private key to authenticate clients<br>- Decrypts and encrypts all traffic for connected peers |

#### Step 2: Key Exchange & Authentication

1. Each device has:

   * **Private Key** (kept secret)
   * **Public Key** (shared with peers)
2. Devices exchange public keys (manually or via config)
3. Each device computes a **shared symmetric session key**
4. All traffic is now encrypted end-to-end

#### Step 3: IP Assignment and Routing

WireGuard assigns **private VPN IP addresses** to each device.

* These IPs are **not public** and only exist within the VPN.
* They can be in any RFC1918 private range (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`, `192.168.50.0/24`) or in a custom range like `100.64.0.0/10` (commonly used in WireGuard mesh VPNs).
* The IPs allow devices to address each other **like on a local network**.

**Example Configuration:**

```
Laptop:    10.0.0.5
HomeServer: 10.0.0.1
```

* Laptop sends packets to `10.0.0.1`.
* WireGuard encapsulates and encrypts packets, then routes them over the internet to the server‚Äôs public IP.
* Server WireGuard decapsulates and decrypts, delivering the packet internally.

This **creates a virtual private LAN** without exposing ports publicly.

---

#### Step 4: VPN Tunnel

1. Laptop authenticates using asymmetric keys
2. Tunnel is established between WireGuard processes
3. Laptop can reach the home server via its VPN IP (e.g., `10.0.0.1`)
4. WireGuard handles:

   * **Encapsulation of packets**
   * **Encryption/decryption**
   * **Routing within VPN**
5. All traffic is **peer-to-peer** and fully encrypted

**Diagram:**

```
Laptop (WireGuard)
  ‚îÇ Private IP: 10.0.0.5
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îÇ  Encrypted VPN tunnel (over internet)
  ‚îÇ
Home Server (WireGuard)
  ‚îÇ Private IP: 10.0.0.1
```

> No public ports on the server need to be exposed for VPN communication ‚Äî only the WireGuard UDP port is open.
> VPN IPs are fully private and only visible within the VPN.

---

### 2.2 Security Foundations

WireGuard uses **asymmetric cryptography**:

* **Private Key**: kept secret on each device
* **Public Key**: shared with peers
* Shared symmetric session key for encryption
* All traffic is authenticated and encrypted end-to-end

Even on public Wi-Fi, **no one can read or tamper with traffic**.

## 3. Coordinating Devices: Tailscale and Headscale

So far, we have seen how **classic WireGuard VPN** works: devices exchange keys manually and establish a secure tunnel.  
But there are some limitations with this approach:

---

### 3.1 Limitations Without a Coordination Layer

Without a coordination server:

* Every device must be **configured manually** with the public key and VPN IP of every other device.
* Adding new devices is tedious ‚Äî you must update all configs.
* NAT traversal or firewalls can prevent direct connections.
* There is no central management of users or devices.

This becomes cumbersome if you have **multiple devices** at home or want a mesh network where all devices communicate peer-to-peer.

---

### 3.2 Tailscale: Automatic Device Discovery

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is a modern VPN solution built on top of WireGuard that **automates key exchange and discovery**:

* Devices register with a **central coordination server** (run by Tailscale Inc.)
* Public keys, VPN IPs, and device metadata are automatically distributed
* NAT traversal is handled automatically
* Devices can connect **peer-to-peer**, but new devices are easy to add

**Key point:** Tailscale simplifies management, but relies on a **third-party cloud server** to coordinate devices.  
Your traffic remains end-to-end encrypted via WireGuard, but the metadata (device names, IPs, keys) is stored by Tailscale.

---

### 3.3 Headscale: Self-Hosted Tailscale Alternative

[Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) is an **open-source, self-hosted alternative** to the Tailscale coordination server:

* Implements the **same protocol as Tailscale**  
* Allows the use of **official Tailscale clients** on all devices  
* Runs on **your own server** ‚Äî you control all keys, IPs, and device metadata  
* Handles **automatic key distribution, device discovery, and NAT traversal**  

**In other words:**  
> Headscale = Tailscale without the cloud.

---

### 3.4 How Headscale Complements WireGuard

WireGuard alone:

* Provides **encrypted tunnels**  
* Requires **manual configuration** of keys and IPs  
* No device discovery or coordination

WireGuard + Headscale:

* Headscale acts as a **control plane**  
* Devices still use WireGuard for **all encryption and data transfer**  
* Headscale only **distributes keys, assigns private VPN IPs, and helps peers find each other**  
* New devices can join easily without manually editing configs

**Installation Requirements:**

* **All devices** still need **WireGuard** installed (it handles encryption/tunnels)  
* Headscale runs **on a single server** for coordination  
* Devices do **not need a full Tailscale server**, only the Tailscale client (which uses WireGuard)
